# codevember2015
Repo for the annual codevember

Please download Unity and check out this repository which contains an empty Unity2D project. Try to make yourself familiar with the programs interface. You are free to use the built-in editor or your favourite editor as the code is directly compiled in Unity on project startup and doesn't need custom build tools. 

We suggest to peak into the manual at http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html to get a first grip at Unity's datatypes and structure (e.g. assets), but thats not absolutly necessary - we will give a intro on friday evening and eventually on saturday morning.

Feel free to contact me on telegram https://telegram.me/tschulzi for any question regarding the project setup with git.
